Implementing a simple python http server and cookies. 

No problems were faced developing the code. This project, between teammates, took cumulatively around 4 hours.

This password server is insecure because it is not an accurate representation of how cookies actually work the way we use them: our program only supports one browser session and it is restarted as the program, and cookies are not cleared. The passwords are also sent in plain text.
